    <h1><strong>Graduation</strong></h1> 
        <h2><strong>Across the stage</strong></h2>
    <p><em>Memories</em></p>
    <p>With our hands raised, our hearts brimming with pride,<br> we walked hand in hand. <br>Book closed, our tales unleashed, <br> fearless and bold into the world. </p>
    <p>Dark nights and bright mornings <br>have given way to the light of the future.<br> Dreams soar, farewell linger, <br>Achapter closes with the horizon sight.</p>     
    <p>We head off, ready to create the life <br>that awaits us, memories in hand.</p>
